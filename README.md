## Employee Analyzer

               1. The Employee Analyzer works for the company to increase productivity by analyzing daily working of Employees.
               2. The admin(manager/hr) can analyze Employee by the graph whether he/she is spending more time in documentation/coding/internet/sql.
               3. The privacy of the employee won't be recorded as the admin would only see the graph based on categories as specified above. 



## How it works

              As the Employee login's the system, the data is  captured through command prompt which is converted into csv file  and then stored into a centralized database.
The  applications used by the Employee are captured and categorised in 4 types i.e. documentation,coding,internet and sql. A graph has been prepared by using the data
from the centralised database. The Admin can view the graph by signing in through the Admin Home-Page and can analyze the time spent by an Employee in a particular category.
